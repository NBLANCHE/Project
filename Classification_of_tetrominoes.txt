After review the code, I figure the following system would be most 
suitable, given how the ShapeLibrary.h is created. 

The system: 

-Default Positions are the positions resembling the letters.
-Orientations are obtained by rotating the shape COUNTERCLOCKWISE by 
90 degrees.The first rotation would be 1, and the second rotation would 
be 2 etc. 

This enables for easy and logical array storage (which is what is already
being used in ShapeLibrary), i.e.
0-Default Position 
1-First rotation
2-Second rotation 
3-Third Rotation 

Please note that the names for the tetrominoes here were used in the code 
for simplicity.I think we should stay consistent and save the fancy names 
for the public.:)

(No other rotation availabe, we're dropping the horizontal "I" due to kinect
constraints)
