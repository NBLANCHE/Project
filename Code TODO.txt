Want to set up the following loop:
- make shape
- new random shape...



Upload as new shape format:
- Don't change how C++ passes it
- C# sends full shape tweetristo
  - must black out irrelevant areas
- C# cuts shape up into sub-shape squares:
  - posts each to TweetrisTOshh (password: squiggle), according to derek's format


Twitpic detecting as video...why?

Incorporate Kinect To Max project (OSC to Max/MSP) into main project according to Kyle's message format.

Have debug vs real window configuration.
